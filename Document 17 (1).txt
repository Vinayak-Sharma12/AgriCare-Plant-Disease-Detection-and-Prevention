1. Tomato Cedar Rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae)
Cause:
•

•

Tomato Cedar Rust is caused by the fungus Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae,
which has a complex life cycle involving two hosts: juniper trees (commonly called
cedar) and tomato plants.
The fungus overwinters in galls (swollen growths) on junipers, which release spores
(aeciospores) in the spring. These spores infect tomato plants, where they cause
damage.

Symptoms:
•

•

Tomatoes: Yellow-orange spots with concentric ring patterns appear on leaves.
These spots can lead to premature leaf drop. Severe cases may cause scarring or
lesions on the fruit.
Junipers: The rust forms reddish-orange galls on juniper branches, which release
spores into the air to infect tomatoes.

Conditions for Development:
•
•

High humidity, wet conditions, and warm temperatures (70°F to 85°F or 21°C to
29°C) are ideal for spore production and fungal growth.
The disease is more common when there are juniper trees planted close to tomato
fields.

Prevention & Remedies:
•
•
•

Cultural control: Remove nearby juniper trees and eliminate plant debris to reduce
the spread of the disease.
Fungicides: Use copper-based fungicides or sulfur to protect plants, particularly in
the early stages or when symptoms first appear.
Resistant varieties: Plant rust-resistant tomato varieties if available.

2. Tomato Early Blight (Alternaria solani)
Cause:

•

Tomato Early Blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani, which infects
tomatoes and other solanaceous crops. The fungus thrives in warm, humid
conditions and can spread quickly via rain or wind.

Symptoms:
•

•
•

Leaves: Dark, circular lesions with concentric rings develop, often with a yellow
halo around the lesion. Older leaves are typically affected first, and the disease
progresses upwards.
Fruit and stems: The fungus can also affect tomato fruits and stems, causing dark,
sunken lesions.
Premature leaf drop can lead to significant yield loss.

Conditions for Development:
•
•

Warm (70°F to 85°F or 21°C to 29°C) and wet conditions are ideal for spore spread.
Disease is spread via soilborne spores or infected plant debris.

Prevention & Remedies:
•
•
•

Cultural control: Rotate crops to avoid planting tomatoes in the same location
annually. Remove fallen leaves and plant debris regularly.
Fungicides: Use fungicides containing copper or mancozeb. Applications should
begin early in the season to protect plants.
Resistant varieties: Plant disease-resistant tomato varieties where available.

3. Corn Common Rust (Puccinia sorghi)
Cause:
•
•

Common Rust of corn is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, which infects the
leaves, husks, and occasionally the ears of corn.
The fungus overwinters on corn debris and is spread by airborne spores
(urediniospores), which are carried by the wind.

Symptoms:
•

Leaves: Small, reddish-brown pustules appear on the upper side of leaves. These
pustules release spores that spread to other parts of the plant.

•

Severe infections: Can cause premature leaf death, reducing the plant's ability to
photosynthesize and leading to yield loss.

Conditions for Development:
•

Common rust is favored by warm, moist conditions. It can occur at any stage of
corn growth but is more problematic during the early summer.

Prevention & Remedies:
•
•
•

Cultural control: Use crop rotation and remove infected debris after harvest to
reduce spore buildup.
Fungicides: Foliar fungicides like chlorothalonil, azoxystrobin, or tebuconazole can
control the spread of the disease.
Resistant varieties: Plant rust-resistant hybrids to reduce the risk of infection.

4. Tomato Yellow Curl Virus (TYLCV)
Cause:
•
•

Tomato Yellow Curl Virus (TYLCV) is caused by a geminivirus and is transmitted
primarily by the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci).
It infects tomatoes and other solanaceous plants, causing significant yield losses in
tropical and subtropical regions.

Symptoms:
•
•
•

Leaf curling: Leaves develop a characteristic upward curl with a yellowing between
veins (interveinal chlorosis).
Stunting: Infected plants are typically stunted, with reduced growth and poor fruit
production.
Fruit: Tomatoes may become smaller, deformed, and misshapen, with poor quality
and reduced yield.

Conditions for Development:
•
•

High temperatures and dry conditions favor the spread of whiteflies, which are
responsible for transmitting the virus.
Dense planting can also increase the likelihood of whitefly infestations.

Prevention & Remedies:
•
•
•
•

Cultural control: Use reflective mulches or trap crops to repel whiteflies. Remove
infected plants immediately.
Insecticides: Use insecticides to control whiteflies, although insecticide resistance
is a growing concern. Neem oil and pyrethroids may offer some control.
Resistant varieties: Plant TYLCV-resistant tomato varieties.
Biological control: Release natural predators of whiteflies, such as Encarsia
formosa.

5. Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis)
Cause:
•

Apple Scab is a fungal disease caused by Venturia inaequalis, which primarily
affects apples and pears. The disease overwinters in fallen leaves and produces
spores during the wet spring months.

Symptoms:
•

•
•

Leaves: Dark, olive-green to black lesions with irregular shapes appear on the
upper side of leaves. As the disease progresses, affected leaves may yellow, curl,
and fall prematurely.
Fruit: Dark, sunken lesions develop on the fruit, causing it to deform and become
unsightly. Infected fruit may also become cracked or scarred.
Twigs: In severe cases, small black lesions can form on twigs, leading to dieback.

Conditions for Development:
•
•

Cool, wet conditions (50°F to 75°F or 10°C to 24°C) are ideal for the development of
apple scab.
Rain or heavy dew is necessary for the spores to be released and infect the leaves
and fruit.

Prevention & Remedies:
•

Cultural control: Remove fallen leaves and prune infected branches. Ensure
proper tree spacing to improve air circulation.

•

•

Fungicides: Copper-based fungicides, sulfur, or specific systemic fungicides (e.g.,
captan, chlorothalonil) should be applied during the early spring and continued
throughout the growing season, especially during wet weather.
Resistant varieties: Plant resistant or tolerant apple varieties, such as Enterprise,
Liberty, and Freedom.

6. Apple Cedar Rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae)
Cause:
•

Apple Cedar Rust is a fungal disease caused by the same pathogen responsible for
Tomato Cedar Rust, Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae. This pathogen infects
apples, pears, and related species, requiring both cedar (juniper) and apple trees to
complete its life cycle.

Symptoms:
•

•

Apple trees: Infected leaves develop bright yellow spots with orange centers.
Lesions eventually turn brown and cause premature leaf drop. The fungus can also
infect twigs and fruit, causing deformities and scarring.
Junipers (cedars): Reddish-orange galls form on juniper trees, and these galls
release spores that infect apple trees.

Conditions for Development:
•

Wet, spring weather is required for spore production and transmission. The spores
are carried by wind and water to apple trees.

Prevention & Remedies:
•
•

•

Cultural control: Remove nearby cedar trees and prune affected apple trees to
limit the spread of the disease.
Fungicides: Fungicides such as copper-based solutions or mancozeb can help
control the spread of the fungus, especially during early spring when the disease is
most active.
Resistant varieties: Plant apple varieties that are resistant to cedar rust, such as
Arkansas Black, Jonafree, and Enterprise.
